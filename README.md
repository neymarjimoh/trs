## About

This Project, TRS , is an application to handle, manage and automate the processes of the railway reservation system in Nigeria.

## Why

We decided to take on the problem of helping to find innovative ways that can help railway users  reserve and book trains avialable without needing to go through the stress of booking tickets physically at train stations where there are long and large queues.

We believe the Railway system is not taken as serious as it should, and this has made it more difficult for people to travel from place to place by trains.

With this app, we aim to make it easier for railway users to get access to available trains depending on their place and time of departure, with a confidential and cost effective approach.
